Somewhere along the road I decided that going straight into university after my A-levels wasn’t for me. Instead, I decided that I would take my increasing passion for the gym and turn it into a career! I completed a personal training and fitness instructor qualification over the next few months and off I went. The next four years were spent training clients on a one-to-one basis, instructing group classes (spinning, boxercise, circuits) and loving every second of it!

Throughout these four years, I also went on a cycle tour around the Netherlands and Belgium, backpacking around Australia and exploring the incredible country of Iceland; these all need and deserve their own blog post in the future.

After the passing of a friend, mentor and boss at the gym I worked out, I decided that I needed a change of pace and environment. Thus, I finally got round to going to University, just four years after everyone else my age! So for the last three years I’ve been at the University of Leeds studying Sport and Exercise Science and I’m happy to report i graduated with honours last summer.

Since graduating, I’ve been interailing around Europe, personal training, working for a wedding events company (think i want to go into the events industry) and have a few weeks before I leave to travel around USA.

Hopefully, you are all caught up for the time being…the plan is to do more in depth blogs on my experiences, fitness and lifestyle topics!

See you soon!

P.S. The picture is of me looking over the city of Barcelona from the ‘MUHBA Turó de la Rovira’ (the old bunkers from the Spanish Civil War). It was an epic view, highly recommend, however it is a serious trek up there!
